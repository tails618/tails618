Hi! I'm a student studying computer science and astrophysics at the University of Chicago.

## some pretty cool things I've done
- I was on my high school's *FIRST Robotics Competition* team, [Cache Money](https://github.com/cachemoney8096), for four years, wrote code for six robots, and served as a lead programmer for two years.
- I made a machine learning model to classify transient astronomical events as part of a program at Northwestern's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics - check it out [here](https://github.com/tails618/ciera-reach-2022).
- I was one of the creators of my high school's student council website, built using React.
